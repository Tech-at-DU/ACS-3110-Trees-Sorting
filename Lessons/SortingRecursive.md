### Challenges
- Implement quick sort algorithm and partition helper function using [sorting starter code]:
    - Implement `partition(items, low, high)` that chooses a pivot and returns index `p` after [in-place] partitioning `items` in range `[low...high]` by moving items less than pivot into range `[low...p-1]`, items greater than pivot into range `[p+1...high]`, and pivot into index `p`
        - [Choose a pivot] in any way: first, last, middle, median-of-three, or random
        - Use any partitioning scheme: [Lomuto], [Hoare], or [three-way]
    - Implement `quick_sort(items, low, high)` that sorts `items` [in-place] by using `partition` algorithm on `items` in range `[low...high]` and *recursively calls itself* on sublist ranges
        - Use the [divide-and-conquer] problem-solving strategy:
            1. Divide: split problem into subproblems (partition input list into sublist ranges)
            2. Conquer: solve subproblems independently (sort sublist ranges recursively with quick sort)
            3. Combine: combine subproblem solutions together (if partition is [in-place], list is already sorted, but if not then concatenate sorted sublists)
        - Remember to add a base case to avoid infinite recursion loops (*hint:* very small list ranges are always sorted)
- Annotate functions with complexity analysis of running time (operations) and space (memory usage)
- Run `python sorting.py` to test quick sort algorithm on random samples of integers, for example:
    ```
    $ python sorting.py quick_sort 10 20
    Initial items: [3, 15, 4, 7, 20, 6, 18, 11, 9, 7]
    Sorting items with quick_sort(items)
    Sorted items:  [3, 4, 6, 7, 7, 9, 11, 15, 18, 20]
    ```
    - Experiment with different list sizes to find when iterative sorting algorithms are slow and quick sort is fast
    - Compare the runtime of quick sort to merge sort on large list sizes with a variety of integer distributions
- Run `pytest sorting_test.py` to run the [sorting unit tests] and fix any failures

### Stretch Challenges
- Try other techniques to [choose a pivot] and other partitioning schemes
- Implement [sample sort] using a multi-way partition algorithm and compare it to quick sort
- Implement [stable][stability] quick sort with a separate *stable* partition algorithm, then compare its time and space complexity (with algorithm analysis or performance benchmarking) to unstable quick sort
- Implement [slow sort] (just for fun)
