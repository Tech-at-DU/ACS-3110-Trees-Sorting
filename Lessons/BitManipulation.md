## Bit Manipulation

### Class 1 Topics
- Read and discuss [course syllabus]
- Review bits and binary numbers
- [Bitwise operations]: and, or, xor, not, left shift, right shift
- [Bit manipulation] algorithms: set, clear, flip, is set, modify
- Bit twiddling tricks: is even, is power of two

### Class 2 Topics
- Review [tree traversal]
  - [Depth-first search]: pre-order, post-order, in-order traversal
  - [Breadth-first search]: level-order traversal

### Resources
<!-- - Review Make School's [bit manipulation slides] as well as [number bases resources] and [tree traversal resources] -->
- Read Vaidehi Joshi's [article on binary][BaseCS binary] with beautiful drawings and excellent examples
- Play with Stephan Brumme's [interactive bit manipulator] and review his [bit twiddling collection] with code explanations and performance ratings
- Watch HackerRank's [bit manipulation video] and [lonely integer problem video] (*spoiler alert:* contains solution code)
- Peruse Sean Anderson's huge collection of [bit twiddling hacks]
- Read Wikipedia's article on the [fast inverse square root] algorithm found in the *Quake III* graphics engine source code â€“ the most well-studied bit twiddling hack ever found
- Read BetterExplained's [article on understanding Quake's fast inverse square root][BE fast inverse square root]
- Step through Lee Gao's slides on [reinventing fast inverse roots] using 8th grade math
- Read Christian Hansen's thorough analysis of the [magic constant 0x5f3759df]
