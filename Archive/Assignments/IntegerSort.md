# Integer Sorting Code Challenge

## Description
In this project we will practice implementing and analyzing the following integer sorting algorithms:
- Bucket Sort
- Counting Sort

## Learning Outcomes
By completing this project, you should be able toâ€¦

1. Explain what an integers sorting algorithm is
1. Explain how bucket sort and counting sort
1. Be able to implement the above sorting algorithms in Python
1. Be able to test the above sorting algorithms
1. Be able to analyze the above sorting algorithms in terms of time complexity

## Requirements

## Starter Code

Use the [integer sorting challenge starter code](https://github.com/Tech-at-DU/ACS-3110-Trees-Sorting/blob/master/Code/sorting_integer.py) and [test file](https://github.com/Tech-at-DU/ACS-3110-Trees-Sorting/blob/master/Code/sorting_test.py) to get started.

### Submission Requirements:
1. Your submitted code should be in a new (public) repo on Github.
1. Your repository should have a minimum of **5 commits**.
1. Your repository should include a README with the name of your Calculator and a description.
1. Submit the link to your repo on Gradescope.
1. Create a demo video. The demo should include a walkthrough of your code and demonstration of how your bot working.

## Requirements
1. Complete `bucket_sort()`
1. Complete `counting_sort()`
1. Have each sorting function pass all tests in the [test file](https://github.com/Tech-at-DU/ACS-3110-Trees-Sorting/blob/master/Code/sorting_test.py)

## Rubric
This project will be graded using the [CS 2.1 Coding Challenges Rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WZByGjbjZdXvdjUylzVywV-ndlQxM8NCoIlxlgaB3vQ/edit?usp=sharing)
